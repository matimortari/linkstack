## ‚úçÔ∏è Developer Note

**LinkStack** is my first own full-stack project built from scratch, and it has been a rewarding journey. While tools like **Linktree** exist, I wanted to challenge myself by creating a similar platform from the ground up. Throughout the process, I aimed to deepen my understanding of concepts such as project structure and multiple layouts in Next.js, along with state management and data fetching (in which **React Query** proved to be a great tool for me). I also wanted to improve my responsive design skills with **Tailwind CSS**, and learn data visualization with my library of choice, **Recharts**.
